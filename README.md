## Gumbi Dots!!

Just trying to store my dotfiles and keep everything organized.

I'll update this when I get everything working correctly.

I know that the bash script can be cleaned up quite a bit, but I am very new to bash scripting so that'll come later.

A decent amount of this is modified from or directly from other sources so I'll work on mentioning and crediting people correclty once I get everything together, give me a bit of time.
